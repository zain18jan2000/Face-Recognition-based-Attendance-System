# Face-Recognization-based-Attendance-System
An implementation of Attendance System in python.

<h1>Pre-requisites</h1>
To understand the implentation of Facial recognization based Attendance System you  must have, <br>
– Basic understanding of Image Classification<br>
– Knowledge of Python and Deep Learning<br>
<br><br>
<h1>Dependencies</h1><br>
1- OpenCV <br>
2- dlib<br>
3- face_recognition <br>
4- os <br>
5- imutils <br>'
6- numpy <br>
7- pickle <br>
8- datetime <br>
9- Pandas <br>



Face is the crucial part of the human body that uniquely identifies a person. Using the face characteristics the face recognition projects can be implemented. The  technique which I have used  to  implent this priject is <b>Deep  Metric Learning<b>. But wait! What is Deep  Metric Learning ? <br>
If you have any prior experience with deep learning you know that we typically train a network to: <br>
Accept a single input image<br>
And output a classification/label for that image <br>
However, deep metric learning is different. Instead, of trying to output a single label, we are outputting a real-valued feature vector. For the dlib facial recognition network, the output feature vector is 128-d (i.e., a list of 128 real-valued numbers) that is used to quantify the face.
  
  
 Implentation of Facial recognization based Attendance System is based on following steps,
